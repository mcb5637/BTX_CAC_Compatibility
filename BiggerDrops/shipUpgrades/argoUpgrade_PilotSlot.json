Most Leopards are supposed to have them, but these are shot to hell. The primary launch actuators are missing, and the pod's data and power connectors are corroded beyond repair. I can get the team to custom-machine the parts to make it operational again. It'll let us perform a single, by-the-book hot drop, just as the manual intended.",
