Right now, we're dropping 'dumb'—the pod gets the BattleMechto the ground safely, but the landing zone is a guess at best. We'll need to install a modern guidance system to give our hot drops some much-needed precision. That'll let us bring the third launcher online and start dropping our 'Mechs exactly where you want them.",
