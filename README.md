# BTX_CAC_Compatibility

Modifies BEX (and BTXMinusWeapons, if present) for CAC.

Installation/Update: (requires working BEX installation)
- Update CAB
- Remove the BTMLColorLOSMod, IRBTModUtils, MechResizer, Retrainer, and StabilePiloting mod folders
- When updating, remove any previous versions of CAC-C, CAE, CAC, CC, CLoc, CPrewarm, CU, and CVoices
- Unpack BTX_CAC_Compatibility, overwriting files

Versioning:
The first 2 parts of the version number match the intended BEX version number.
The other 2 follow semantic versioning.
A "b" as last char in the github release/git tag indicates beta status, this is not included in assembly/mod.json.
There will not be different releases that differ only in this beta marker.

What to do when adding CAC-C into an existing savegame:
- Store and ready every mech that has any of the following fixed equipment:
	- any ECM (you are fine if the component has - X% Detectability as bonus)
	- any ActiveProbe (you are fine if the component has +Xm Sensor Range as bonus)
	- any TSM (you are fine if the in mission GUI shows only one active component for it)
	- MASC (you are fine if the in mission GUI shows only one active component for it)
	- Bull Shark BSK-MAZ (you are fine if it has a fixed Integrated Artillery Mount)
- Remove any equipment and use its new replacements (use the savegame editor to change the parts in your inventory if you want):
	- Liao ECM (Gear_Sensor_Prototype_ECM -> Gear_SensorCAC_LiaoProtoECM)
	- Liao AP (Gear_Sensor_Prototype_ActiveProbe -> Gear_SensorCAC_LiaoProtoAP)
	- AMS upgrade components (Gear_AMS_XXX -> Weapon_AMSCAC_XXX) to AMS weapons & MG ammo
	- Infernos Launcher (Weapon_Inferno_Inferno2_XXX -> Ammo_AmmunitionBox_Generic_SRM_Inferno) to standard SRMs with Inferno ammo
	- Deadfire LRMs/SRMs (Weapon_SRM_DFSRMX_0-STOCK -> Ammo_AmmunitionBox_Generic_SRM_DF)(Weapon_LRM_DFLRMX_0-STOCK -> Ammo_AmmunitionBox_Generic_LRM_DF) to standard LRMs/SRMs with deadfire ammo
	- Mech Mortar (Gear_Mortar_MechMortar -> Weapon_MortarCAC_ThumperFree) to Thumper with matching ammo (requires ballistics slot)
	- Artemis SRM/LRM (Weapon_SRM_ASRMXXX/Weapon_LRM_ALRMXXX ->  Gear_Addon_Artemis4) to a matching standard SRM/LRM launcher with Artemis IV FCS attachment

TODO BEX 2.0:
- weather acc modifiers?
- component upgrader

TODO List:

- multitarget quirk unlocks without skill? (irtweaks stat)
- a-pods CAE?
- edit texts
- NARC reveals target?
- Flamers & Inferno ammo balance
- ECM tohit balance

Known bugs:
- CustomLoc patchig strings

Optional:
- If you want Urban vehicles to leave blood on destruction, look at CACs settings and change "DrawBloodChance" to 0.3

Manual setup:
- clone git repo, including submodules
- correct paths in dll
- compile
Package for release:
